# MMFWD
Forward calls and texts using ModemManager framework.

This is a daemon that forwards calls and text messages via email and
SIP(planned?). I made this python program to receive KYC messages whilst I'm
overseas. South Korea is a weird county where all KYC verifications are done via
personal mobile number. Without a mobile number, doing anything online is almost
impossible. The daemon can be run on a small and reliable device that is kept
somewhere safe.
